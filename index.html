          <h3>Who is Michael Gieser?</h3>
          <p>Well… I'm no Doogie Howser or Stephen Hawking. What I am though, is a highly motivated, quick learner, that
            loves
            to build things that make people think, "Wow, who made that?!"</p>
          <p>For the past 11 years I have had a successful career in the construction industry as a sheet metal worker
            installing ductwork and HVAC equipment primarily in the commercial sector.</p>
          <p>Of those years, I have spent the last 7 years honing my skills in the specific construction technology
            niche of Robotic Total Station (RTS) layout. Within my local sheet metal union, I am one of, if not the only
            member that has ventured as far into the technology side of construction. As such, I have gained recognition
            and found myself in a position where I am teaching and leading the other members in my union to embrace
            technology and advance the industry into this ever evolving world.</p>
          <p>So what is a construction worker like myself, that seemingly has found great success, doing trying to break
            in to the developer world? Well, to put it bluntly, I feel my skills and potential are wasted in my current
            role.</p>
          <p>I want room to grow and [...]. I have always had a deep interest in all things tech and each day that I
            spend learning and building [...] gets me even more excited for where this new path will take me!</p>

          <h3>What’s So Awesome about Michael Gieser?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>I have great communication skills.</strong> In the world of construction, proper coordination, or the lack thereof, can make or break a project. Over the years I developed a strong skill of being able to work with other trades to resolve clashes in the field. On top of that, my role as an RTS lead required me to possess strong leadership skills. I was in charge of coming up with plans to make sure that there was time and operators available to get the work done. This involved constant and ever changing communication with other trades and office staff. I know that these skills will be very valuable as an employee and team member at Two Barrels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>I strive and excel in improving efficiency.</strong> When I first took on the role of RTS lead, the position was extremely limited and relied heavily on the actions and guidance of my direct supervisor. I took intentional actions to shoulder responsibilities that I knew I could handle to help improve the flow and speed at which things could get done. Without re-inventing the wheel, I also constantly took initiative to implement processes and procedures that were lacking in order to improve project performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>I hold close my desire to have a successful career so that I can have a great family life.</strong> One of the top values that I hold, is being able to provide financially for my family so that they can have an exceptional, full life. Another of my top values is to be able to live that full life with my family and to be able to give my kids lasting memories and strong values that they eventually will carry with them into their adult lives. I love helping neighbors fix a broken fence, or building a deck and pool that my wife wants. I love going on vacations with my wife and kids. I love watching my daughter get more interested in soccer. I love witnessing my son's rapidly evolving personality take shape, and I love that Two Barrels values their employees and wants to make sure they get the time they need to live  their lives.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>I search for solutions with lasting results.</strong> When faced with a problem, I do not look for quick fixes that will eventually need to be addressed again later, sometimes bringing more problems with it. If there is something I don't yet know how to handle, I take the initiative to step out of my box a little and dig into how to solve it myself. Once I feel that I have a grasp on it, even if a little loose, I work through coming up with a solution, owning and quickly correcting all mistakes along the way. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>I push myself to reach higher and refine my skills.</strong> Every step along the way in my sheet metal career, when I reached a goal I was aiming for, I didn't stop and take a break or settle there. I looked at where I could elevate or improve my skills. It seems that with the nature of construction, I have reached as far as I can, and yet I know I can do more and haven't reached as high as I would like. It was suggested to me from a close friend that I might be good at and find interest in software/web development. I decided to dig into it further and was immediately drawn to everything about it. Since discovering this new found passion, I have dove head first into the deep end and have been pushing myself to learn more every day. I know the route of self-taught is a rough road and will take more effort to get a leg up, but that only makes me want to try harder and prove that I can do just as good, if not better. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>I want to work for, and stay with, a stable growing company that I know cares about me.</strong> The union construction workplace can be tough sometimes. As a union tradesperson, you are a member of the union that multiple contractors are signatory with. When one of those companies need a worker, they are required to hire a union member. This employer/employee relationship often results in the contractors seeing and using the union members as numbers. Thats why, when I obtained employment with my most recent employer, I did everything I could to retain a position in that company. From when I was a new apprentice, just learning the ropes, to now, I have always felt seen and respected as a fellow human with a life outside of work. Everything I have read bout Two Barrels in my process of applying for employment with them, has shown me that they hold these same values and level of respect for their employees. This is among one of the top reasons why I really want to work for Two Barrels.

          <h4>What’s Up with the Gieser Name?</h4>
          <p>Well. Glad you’re wondering. It's German, and for that reason, the "ie" is pronounced as a hard "E" instead
            of the typical hard "I". So it's "Geezer" (like old man, but
            that's my father, I'm the young Gieser), or as my wife prefers to explain it, "Geese"-er like the bird. That
            being said, I am not easily offended. "Geyser", "Geezer", "Geez", "Hey you"... I'll gladly answer to
            whatever you call me when you do!</p>
