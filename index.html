          <h3>Who is Michael Gieser?</h3>
          <p>Well… I'm no Doogie Howser or Stephen Hawking. What I am, is a highly motivated, quick learner, that loves to build things that make people think, "Wow, who made that?!"</p>
          <p>For the past 11 years I have had a successful career in the constuction industry as a sheet metal worker installing ductwork and HVAC equipment primarily in the commercial sector.</p>
          <p>Of those years, I have spent the last 7 years honing my skills  in the specific construction technology niche of Robotic Total Staion (RTS) layout. Within my local sheet metal union, I am one of, if not the only member that has ventured as far into the technology side of construction. As such, I have gained recognition and found myself in a position where I am teaching and leading the other members in my union to embrace technology and advance the industry into this ever evolving world.</p>
          <p>So what is a constuction worker, like myself, that seemingly has found great success, doing trying to break in to the developer world? Well, to put it bluntly, I feel my skills and potential are wasted in my current role.</p>
          <p>We’ve grown into Spokane’s largest tech employer as of 2021. And we’re no where close to where we need to
            be.
            We’re
            continually growing our team as we provide the backbone for millions of businesses throughout the US.</p>

          <h3>What’s So Awesome about Michael Gieser?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>We do lots of stuff in house.</strong> It’s all-too-common for modern tech companies to contract
              out
              writers and designers for individual projects. Some
              companies have developers who have never met in person because they’re all working remotely. Software
              engineers, systems
              engineers, front-end developers, designers, writers—at Two Barrels, we all worked in the same building,
              and
              now we’ve
              spread out all over the world. Full time, not contracted out. Every person who contributes to a product
              can
              talk to each
              other and work together from beginning to end. And one of the best things about this? We make really good
              friends here.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We’re trusted to explore solutions.</strong> We often end up creating our own, smaller projects to
              fix problems, make processes more efficient, or improve SEO. We
              have freedom to test out hypotheses, try out new voices in writing projects, and build things that will
              help
              the team.
              We’re grouped by Products so we have full autonomy to make our products as amazing as we can dream up.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We’re encouraged to have a life outside of work.</strong> So many employers are willing to lose an
              amazing employee because they’re unwilling to accommodate life outside of work.
              Employees have families. They have daycare drop-off times to negotiate. Late-night concerts. Early morning
              gym classes.
              Plumbing disasters. At Two Barrels, we need to see each other to work together, so we have a basic
              schedule
              of Monday
              through Friday, roughly 8 hours a day. But our start and end times are flexible. We can come in at 6am one
              day and 10am
              the next. If we need to take a two-hour break midday for a dentist appointment, that’s no problem.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We don’t have to get promoted to get a raise.</strong> Honestly, the corporate ladder is kind of a
              dumb idea. Why hire the best engineers and designers and then tell them they
              can’t make more money unless they move up into management? That’s how companies lose their best workers
              (and
              end up with
              lousy management). At Two Barrels, we’re hired for the job we do best. Writers write. Coders code. Then we
              get annual
              raise opportunities. We never have to give up a position we love and excel at for a “promotion.”
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We have the tools we need for our jobs.</strong> A recent example—one of our designers made an
              offhand comment that illustrations would be much easier if she had an iPad
              Pro. The office manager told her to find one online and send her a link. She ordered it for her the same
              day, and our
              designer was illustrating on her new device within the week. The company trusts that we know what we need
              to
              do our jobs
              best. We don’t get everything under the sun (apparently we go through Slim Jims “too fast”), but we can
              request what we
              need and get it more often than not.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We’re hired based on our skills, not made-up criteria.</strong> Some people here have 20+ years of
              experience. Others are just a year or two into the industry. A few people have
              multiple graduate degrees. Others are self-taught. What matters most is the skills we bring to the table.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We’re allowed to be comfortable.</strong> We have an open office where we can get up whenever we
              want. We can listen to music. We have floor mats and standing
              desks for people who think better on their feet. We’re not client-facing, so there’s no dress code.
              Sneakers, heels,
              bunny slippers…we can work however we work best.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We’re here for the long haul.</strong> We’ve grown so much that the company just bought a 65,000
              square foot building in the heart of downtown Spokane. Our new
              home is currently being built out specifically to meet our team’s needs. Private space to work. Stand up
              areas. Sprint
              planning areas. Everything a modern tech team could dream of.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>What’s Up with the Gieser Name?</h4>
          <p>Well. Glad you’re wondering. It's German, and for that reason, it is pronounced "Geezer" (like old man, but that's my father, I'm the young Gieser), or as my wife prefers to explain it "Geese-er".</p>
